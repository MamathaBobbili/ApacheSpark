JVM---------------Java Virtual Machine.

JRE--------------Java Runtime Environment

JRE--------------JVM+System Libraries.


JVM is used to convert the java bytecode to runtime instruction.


Scala based interactive shell for spark is called spark-shell.
Python based interactive shell for spark is called pyspark.

RDD-----------Resilent Distributed Dataset-------------------Fundamental unit of data in spark.


worker is the spark node --------- node connected to the master

multiple spark nodes create the cluster.

master is also called cluster manager.

executor is the jvm in the worker node which runs the task.

In each worker node, multiple executors may be running.



sc is the implicit object to access spark core
spark is the implicit object to access spark session

master------------local[*]------------it executes the job parallely across multiple cpus in the local machine.

The map() function applies the parameter function to each element in the rdd and returns another rdd.

The flatMap() function is similar to map() except that it flattens the data at last.

The parameter function passed to flatMap returns a collection for each element. So the result will become two dimensional. Since flatMap() flattens
the data at last, it still remains as one dimensional.
